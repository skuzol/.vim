## Vim setup

This repository was created to easily download my setup for the **Vim text-editor** whenever I reinstall/change my device.

The installed modules in it are created as submodules from another repositories so if there is an update they can be easily "*git pull*"-ed.

### Instalation:

Just clone this repository to your "/home/{username}/.vim/" folder and you are good to go. 

For newbies there is a step-by-step instalation guide below:

1. *(optional)* If you don't have the .vim folder, create it:

```
cd && mkdir .vim && cd .vim/
```
2. Clone the repository:
``` 
git clone https://github.com/skuzol/vim.git
```
3. Enjoy!
